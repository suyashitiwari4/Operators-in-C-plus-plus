# AIM: To study and implement Operators in C++

# SOFTWARE REQUIRED:

Visual Studio

# THEORY: 

An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical manipulations. C++ is rich in built-in operators and provide the following types of operators −

1.Arithmetic Operators
2.Relational Operators
3.Logical Operators
4.Bitwise Operators
5.Assignment Operators
6.Arithmetic Operators:

# .)Arithmetic Operators:
Arithmetic operators in C++ are the basic operators, which are used for basic mathematical or arithmetical operations on operands. These operators are essential for performing calculations and manipulating data within a program. There are following arithmetic operators supported by C++ languag

# .)Relational Operators:
Relational operators are used to compare two values or expressions. These operators return a boolean value − true if the comparison is correct, and else false. They are essential for making decisions and controlling the flow of a program based on conditions. There are following relational operators supported by C++ language,

# .)Logical Operators:
Logical operators are used to perform logical operations on boolean values (true or false). These operators are essential for controlling the flow of a program based on conditions. There are three primary logical operators in C++ as mentioned below − There are following logical operators supported by C++ language,

# .)Bitwise Operators:
Bitwise operators are used to perform operations at the bit level on integer data types. These operations work on direct manipulation of bits, such as low-level programming, graphics, and cryptography.

# .)Assignment Operators:
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. These operators allow you to set or update the value stored in a variable.

# IMPLEMENTATION:

In this practical I have used different types of operators in the following cases,

1.Positive or Negative number check:
This uses the comparition operators which help to identify negative and positive numbers.

2.Student grade Determination:
This uses the mix of Comparision and Logical Operators to alot grades according to the average marks in the 5 subjects.

3.Quadrant Determination:
This also uses the mix of Comparision and Logical Operators to determine the quadrant according to the coordinates , which are entered by the user.

# CONCLUSION:
I explored various Types of Operators in C++ and understood the usage of the operators.
